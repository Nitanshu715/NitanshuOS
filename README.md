## ✨ TL;DR – What is NitanshuOS?

**NitanshuOS** is a **custom Linux distribution** that I built using **Buildroot**, targeted at **x86_64** and booted using **QEMU**.  
It’s not an Ubuntu remix or a pre-made ISO tweak – it’s a **from-scratch root filesystem, custom kernel, boot flow, and automation scripts**.

Think of it as:

> “If Arch Linux and embedded DevOps had a tiny, efficient, minimal-but-powerful baby that boots instantly and speaks SSH.”

---

## 🚀 Core Highlights

- ✅ **Fully custom root filesystem** generated via Buildroot
- ✅ **Custom Linux kernel** (configured & compiled by hand)
- ✅ Clean **boot banner & OS branding** – `Welcome to NitanshuOS!!`
- ✅ Proper **`/etc/os-release`** so the OS identifies as:
  ```bash
  NAME="NitanshuOS"
  ID=nitanshuos
  PRETTY_NAME="NitanshuOS (Buildroot-based custom Linux)"
  VERSION="1.0"
  ```
- ✅ **Networking stack working** (eth0, IPv4, IPv6, routing)
- ✅ **BusyBox userland** with standard Unix tooling
- ✅ **Dropbear SSH server** running on boot (remote login ready)
- ✅ **Automated disk image creation** via a custom `post-image.sh` script
- ✅ Reproducible build: **entire OS can be rebuilt from config**

AWS import is currently blocked by **strict kernel version validation** on AMI import (more on that below 👇), but the local OS itself is legit, bootable, and fully functional.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 1️⃣ Build System – Buildroot

NitanshuOS is built with **Buildroot 2025.11-rc1**.  
Buildroot is responsible for:

- Fetching and compiling the Linux kernel
- Building the root filesystem (BusyBox + libraries + tools)
- Generating the initial ext2 rootfs image (`rootfs.ext2`)
- Producing the kernel image (`bzImage`)

Key file in this repo:

- `configs/buildroot-config`  
  → exact `.config` used to generate NitanshuOS.  
  Anyone can reproduce my OS by dropping this into a Buildroot tree and running:

  ```bash
  make menuconfig     # (optional – to inspect)
  make                # full system build
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ Kernel – Custom Linux

- Base: **mainline Linux 5.10.220** (LTS line)
- Built as a **custom tarball** from kernel.org
- Configured via **x86_64 defconfig** + custom tweaks
- Built as `bzImage` for x86_64

I experimented with:

- **CIP SLTS kernels** (5.10.162-cip24 & RT variants)
- Newer **6.x kernels**

…but AWS import is extremely picky with kernel versions, so NitanshuOS uses a **clean, self-built LTS kernel** that boots reliably under QEMU.

Kernel is configured to support:

- x86_64 PC platform
- Virtio/standard PC disk + net drivers
- TTY console on `ttyS0`
- Filesystems required for the rootfs

---

### 3️⃣ Root Filesystem & Userspace

The root filesystem is a **minimal BusyBox-based system** with:

- Standard Unix tools (`ls`, `ps`, `ip`, `df`, etc.)
- Basic `/etc` layout
- Networking tools (`ip`, `ping`)
- `dropbear` SSH server
- `crond` for scheduled tasks

On boot, NitanshuOS prints:

```text
Welcome to NitanshuOS!!
```

Then you log in as:

- **user:** `root`
- **password:** (set in Buildroot config)

---

### 4️⃣ Custom Disk Image & Boot Flow

By default Buildroot gives you:

- `bzImage` (kernel)
- `rootfs.ext2` (root filesystem)

NitanshuOS goes further using a custom **post-image automation script**:

> `scripts/post-image.sh`

This script:

1. Creates a raw disk image (`nitanshuos.raw`)
2. Partitions it (MBR, single primary ext4 partition, bootable)
3. Formats the partition with ext4
4. Mounts both:
   - rootfs image (`rootfs.ext2`)
   - new disk partition
5. Copies the root filesystem into the disk
6. Drops `bzImage` into the disk root
7. Installs a minimal **GRUB**-based bootloader:
   - Writes `grub.cfg` pointing to `/bzImage`:
     ```cfg
     menuentry "NitanshuOS" {
         linux /bzImage root=/dev/sda1 rw console=ttyS0
     }
     ```
   - Writes GRUB stage1 + core.img into the MBR and first sectors
8. Cleans up loop devices and mounts

End result: a **fully bootable raw disk** (`nitanshuos.raw`) that can be:

- Booted in QEMU  
- Converted to VMDK (`nitanshuos-aws.vmdk`) for cloud experiments

## 🧪 Testing NitanshuOS

All tests done inside **QEMU** on my machine.

### ✅ 1. OS Identity

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

Output:

```bash
NAME="NitanshuOS"
ID=nitanshuos
PRETTY_NAME="NitanshuOS (Buildroot-based custom Linux)"
VERSION="1.0"
```

✅ Confirms branding + OS metadata.

---

### ✅ 2. CPU, RAM & Disk Health

```bash
free -h
df -h
```

Example snapshot:

- Memory: ~94 MB total, ~72 MB free (super lightweight)
- Disk root (`/`): ~182 MB size, ~19 MB used

This proves NitanshuOS is **tiny, efficient and fast** – perfect for cloud/embedded style workloads.

---

### ✅ 3. Network Stack

```bash
ip addr
```

Sample output:

```text
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global eth0
```

Then tested connectivity:

```bash
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
ping -c 4 google.com || echo "DNS might not be set"
```

Even when DNS was misconfigured, interface + routing + stack behaved correctly.  
It’s a **real** networked OS, not just a demo shell.

---

### ✅ 4. DevOps‑style System Snapshot

To show off the system quickly, I used a one-liner:

```bash
echo "[MEMORY]"; free -h; echo; \
echo "[DISK]"; df -h; echo; \
echo "[NETWORK]"; ip addr
```

This prints a **mini health dashboard** in one screenshot – very recruiter‑friendly.

---

## ☁️ AWS AMI Import Journey (aka Boss Fight)

I attempted to turn NitanshuOS into a **custom EC2 AMI** via:

1. Uploading `nitanshuos-aws.vmdk` to S3:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp nitanshuos-aws.vmdk s3://nitanshuos-import-bucket/
   ```
2. Creating/importing via:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 import-image \
     --region ap-south-1 \
     --description "NitanshuOS Buildroot Distro" \
     --disk-containers file://containers.json
   ```

We hit multiple **real‑world cloud issues**:

- Missing / misconfigured `vmimport` IAM role
- S3 permissions for import
- VMDK format constraints (`streamOptimized` requirement)
- Finally: **strict kernel validation** on AWS side

Example failure message from AWS:

```text
CLIENT_ERROR : ClientError: Unsupported kernel version 5.10.220
```

Instead of hiding this, I’m keeping it **transparent in the project** because:

- It shows actual debugging & research work
- It’s a realistic production-style problem
- It opens room for a v2: building an **AWS-approved kernel** or basing NitanshuOS on top of an existing cloud image

Right now NitanshuOS is **fully functional in QEMU**, and AWS support is an **active research track**, not a blocker to calling this a serious OS project.

## 🧠 What I Learned Building NitanshuOS

### Systems & OS Concepts

- How a **Linux system actually boots** (firmware → bootloader → kernel → init → userland)
- Difference between:
  - Kernel image (`bzImage`)
  - Root filesystem (`rootfs.ext2`)
  - Disk image (`.raw`, `.vmdk`)
- Manual GRUB install vs pre-packaged distro images

### Buildroot & Tooling

- Configuring Buildroot for a **custom distro**
- Tweaking kernels, BusyBox, packages
- Rebuilding from `.config` for reproducible output

### Networking

- Bringing up interfaces in a minimal system
- Understanding QEMU’s `10.0.2.x` NAT network
- Debugging DNS vs connectivity

### Cloud / DevOps

- Working with S3, IAM roles, and `vmimport`
- Understanding EC2’s expectations from guest kernels
- Converting & validating disk formats (RAW → VMDK)

### Git & Project Hygiene

- Structuring a repo like a **real open-source project**
- Writing architecture docs instead of just “it works on my laptop”
- Using branches + PR flow on GitHub

## 🧭 How to Rebuild NitanshuOS Yourself

> You need a Linux environment (WSL2 works), Git, and Buildroot.

```bash
# 1. Clone my repo
git clone https://github.com/Nitanshu715/NitanshuOS.git
cd NitanshuOS

# 2. Clone Buildroot (if you don’t already have it)
git clone https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot
cd buildroot

# 3. Drop my config in and build
cp ../configs/buildroot-config .config
make oldconfig      # optional, to review
make                # full system build (this takes time)

# 4. Run post-image script (adapt paths if needed)
cp ../scripts/post-image.sh board/qemu/post-image.sh
chmod +x board/qemu/post-image.sh
# Re-run 'make' so Buildroot calls the post-image hook
make

# 5. Boot with QEMU (example)
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256M -hda output/images/nitanshuos.raw -serial mon:stdio
```

From here, you can SSH into it (if you expose ports) or continue experimenting with cloud import, different kernels, or extra packages.

## 🐳 Dockerized Build & Development Environment

I ship NitanshuOS with a **fully containerized development environment** using Docker. This approach means anyone can experiment with the OS configurations, build the system, or test changes without needing to install Buildroot or any toolchains locally on their machine.

This makes the entire project:

* ✅ Fully **reproducible** across any environment.
* ✅ **Platform-independent** and safe from host system conflicts.
* ✅ A perfect fit for modern DevOps-style workflows and automated builds.

### 🔧 Container Capabilities & Verified Toolchain

Inside the development container, I have successfully verified and used all the necessary tools for the OS lifecycle:

* ✅ GCC toolchain
* ✅ QEMU emulator
* ✅ GNU Make
* ✅ Python 3
* ✅ All Build dependencies required for OS compilation

**Example checks inside the running container:**

```bash
gcc --version
qemu-system-x86_64 --version
make --version
python3 --version
```

# 📦 NitanshuOS Development Environment Workflow

## 🛠️ **Build** the Development Environment Image: `docker build -t nitanshuos-env .`

This command constructs the Docker image named **nitanshuos-env** from the project's **Dockerfile** in the current directory (`.`). This image contains all the necessary dependencies and tools for development.

---

## 🏃 **Run** the Development Container with Local Project Mounted: `docker run -it --name nitanshuos-dev -v ~/NitanshuOS:/workspace nitanshuos-env`

This command performs several actions simultaneously:
* **Runs** the container in **Interactive** and **TTY** modes (`-it`).
* Assigns a user-friendly name, **nitanshuos-dev**, to the container (`--name`).
* **Mounts** your local project directory (`~/NitanshuOS`) into the container's `/workspace` directory (`-v`). This allows you to edit files locally and execute/test them inside the consistent environment.
* Uses the **nitanshuos-env** image.

Once inside the container, you can immediately begin work and verify the mounted structure using a command like `tree -L 3`.
